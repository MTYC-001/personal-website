## OpenAI Data Generator (video-to-text and text-to-images)
In this project I've used JavaScript, Python and OpenAI's API to use ChatGPT to convert any youtube video to text this is useful when you do not want to spent 20-30 mins watching a youtube video, also I've also went ahead and created my own smaller version of midjourney (text-to-image) AI generator.
